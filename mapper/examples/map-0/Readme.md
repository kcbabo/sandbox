Milestone 0 - Baseline App
===========================
This application serves as our baseline application for adding mapping features to the runtime and tooling for Fuse and FSW.  The application demonstrates a transformation from an XML input to a JSON output.  The input and output models have different structures, so this is more than a simple data binding problem.

####Running the App
To build this project use
```
mvn install
```
To run this project with Maven use
```
mvn camel:run
```

The application picks up input XML from the src/data directory and drops output JSON into the target/messages directory.  Note that you will need to kill the Java process (^C in terminal) when using "mvn camel:run", which is the default behavior of this plugin.
